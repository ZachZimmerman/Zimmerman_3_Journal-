The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals
--- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic -
 as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)

I didn’t remember anything, however i asked Jordan and he gave me a really good summary of arrays. But I couldn’t start the rest of it to actually make the array.     

Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

1.What is the difference between an array and ArrayList?
2.What did the while loop do in the array game?
3.What is a 2D array?
4.What is a 3D array?
5.How did the enemies move on there own?
6.Why did the game break if you went to far Left, Right, Up or Down?
7.How do you make multiple boards, like levels?
8.How do you make a weapon to kill the enemies?
9.How can you randomize traps around your map?
10.How do you make mulitple enemies?
