1.How do we make a claass?
public class Donut {
    
}
2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
Is this a class constructor?
It is creating another Donut-itâ€™s calling the class constructor, with Donut();
No there is not constructor in the class.

3.How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
public class Breakfast {
    boolean hasEggs;
int num OfEggs;
boolean hasBacon;
boolean hasOragneJuice;
int slicesOfBreakfast

    Breakfast(int a,int b, boolean c, boolean d, boolean e) {
        this.numOfEggs = a;
        this.slicesOfBacon = b;
        this.hasEggs = c;
        this.hasBacon = d;
        this.hasOrangeJuice = e;

}
//A getter gets things,i.e. namely in java and oop
//a getter is usually public so that it can return private values,e.g. a getter for slices of bacon //would tell other classes how many slices of bacon

public int getSlicesOfBacon() {
    return this.slicesOfBacon;
}
//A getter returns a value, in contrast a setter sets values.
//For example, to set whether we have orange juice.

public void setHasOrangeJuice(boolean a ) {
    this.hasOrangeJuice = a;
}
}




4.an array of Breakfast
int[] breakfast; THIS IS WRONG 

int[] numberz; //This is an array of numbers
char[] characterz; //This is an array of chars
boolena[][] blocked; //This is a 2D array of booleans

Breakfast roedersBreakfast = new Breakfast(2, 4, true, true, true);

Breakfast[] roedersFamiliesBreakfastz = {roedersBreakfast, dadsBreakfast, momsBreakfast, sisBreakfast, grandadBreakfast, grandmaBreakfast};

5.Using getters and setters:
roedersBreakfast.setSlicesOfBacon(12);
//This is using a setter!!

6.This is using a getter!!
