During / after the holiday, we will be constructing "dungeon crawlers" (or side-scrollers).

Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game. 
Why?
I haven't playefd many side scrollers so I don't really know whjat they are like to play or their enviroments.
So I am gonna do "research" this weekend to help me get a better idea of what I want to  do.
