We will have a test on friday. It will be about the notes from last week. Are you ready?
Maybe I have to notes to look at but I am note the best in this class and I don't know everything BUT I HAVE NOTES.

What specific questions do you have about the slick game?
None that ciome to my mind.

We will be revising our Slick game to:
1.Have multiple levels
2.Enemies
3.Traps (or something) defined by an array
4.Give and take damage
5.Score
6.Inventory or some compelling alternative.

What will you have to do to get this working?
Are you perpared?Do you have all the knowledge you need?
1.I'd have to add to my map.
2.Just add more of them.
3.Come up with an idea for a trap.
4.You already take damage from enemies in my game so I just need to fix my orbs and make them give damage.
5.I already have score.
6.I might try to make a certain amount of orbs you have.
