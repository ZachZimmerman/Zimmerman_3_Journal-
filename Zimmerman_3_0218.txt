Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);


Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
It's just something that we won't use because we have an IDE like NetBeans.

What is an array?
Is an collection of things in java like ints or strings.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
boolean[]{

}

What is an ArrayList?
It is a list of numbers.

How do you make an arraylist?
public ArrayList<Goldcoin> coinz = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):

What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?


What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
An array is static and an ArrayList is dynamic. An array can have other data types and an ArrayList are ints.

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
private int health = 100; Then use getters setters
public void takeDamage(int damage){
this.health-- damage;
}
