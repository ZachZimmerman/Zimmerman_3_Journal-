    The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
   
 Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
