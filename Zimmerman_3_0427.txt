The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.

Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
Because computer languages are similar to each other you should be able to pick up on things to learn other languages. This teaches you how to discriminate patterns.

What should students learn from CS?
How to find patterns in real life to learn new things and find new stuff.
