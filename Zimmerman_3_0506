    Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? The x is 43
    Which is the y coordinate? The y is 67
    Why?
    Because with 2D arrays it goes y,x instead of everything else in life like this is x,y
    How does this happen?
    Because the code is telling it to bulid the y first.
    Consider:

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
            
          

    Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
    
    Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
    System.out.println(map[i][j]);
    This is producing the map so it can be seen.

    Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
    System.out.println(".");
    In #e is the y whcih is being placed first. In #c it is the x which is being placed second.
    Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
    System.out.println(map[i][j]);
    It is setting the boundaries for the map.
    Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
    You can have a boolean saying if moving is true then while moving  continue to have the map be made. Then if not moving nothing moves.
 
    Explain the use of static.
    Static can allow your movement method to be used across the entire game and then it doesnt have to be written mmultiple time.

    Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
