    Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
    E.g.,

            for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
                        for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) { ....}


The first for loop tigers the inner loop. When the inner loop finnishes the outer loop will start over and trigger the inner one again.
