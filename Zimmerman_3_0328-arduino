Arduino uses a variant of the C programming language
What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
1.When ever you open the program the voi loops are kinda like methods that can be use through out the program when called.
2.To start a new program it is very similar in how you start.
3.The endings of classes and methods are similar and how to call stuff.

What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
When we added the Piezo code we had to get rid of the void starts and void loops that came with it.

What is required for a circuit?
A power supply witch is the computer through the usb.

How are programs compiled with Arduino?

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them. Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.
Mark and I completed all the examples and have kinda figured out how the wiring works. Now we are working on combining the Piezo abd the LCD screen to have a Jeopardy playing timer. 

You will be completing your own project - a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.
Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make. [Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided - using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
We are gonna make a timer that plays Jeopardy and has a reset botton.
