Create a class for 'Hero'
The class should contain:
variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol
Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name
Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.

package pkgGame;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Hero {

public int health; 
public int score;
public int dexterity;
public int perception;
public int level;
public int x;
public int y;
public int z;
char symbol;
public String name;
public String Weapon = "Rocket Launcher"

Hero (int a, int b, int c,String d,String e) {
this.x =a;
this.y=b;
this.z=c;
this.symbol = d;
this.name = e;
	}
}



public static void main(){
Hero hero = new Hero();
System.out.pritnln("please type in a name");
Scanner scanner1 = new Scanner(System.in);
hero.name = scanner1.nextLine().trim();    


}
