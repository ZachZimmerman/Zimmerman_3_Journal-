What slick game did you create?
A top down thing.

What challenges did you solve?
You have to find  gold coinz while navigating a maze with out getting killed by enemies. 

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
I did not because I don't know why.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
No. I just haven't done everything I've wanted to do.
