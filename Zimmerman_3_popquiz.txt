Say what the difference between MIT and GPL licenses and which one we will use in here.
The MIT gives you all the power over that source code, the GPL is open sourse and can be changed by anyone. 
We will be using GPL so can be stoped from doing stuff we arent suppose and so Mr.Davis can monitor us.
Linux???
