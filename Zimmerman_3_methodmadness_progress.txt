I made someCircles to be random and go all over the place. Then I did the 
same thing for someRectangles. Then I started playing with the cirlce
 colors and ended up making them translucent. Now I want to do some of the
 same thing coming from each corner with a variatiob of shapes and maybe
 colors.
