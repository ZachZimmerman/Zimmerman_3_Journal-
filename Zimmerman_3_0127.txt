How do you add an image to a slick game?
We make a class for the picture so it can have the righ import stuff(like 
import org.newdawn.slick.Image;)
Then in unwavering when we call it we need to give it x&y cordinates so 
the picture knows where to go.

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
The image is drawn in the render class.

point.currentImage.draw(point.x, point.y);
Like that.
