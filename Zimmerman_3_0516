Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Changing values into different values like a int to a float.
TO make it more specific.
Or a float to an int

Give a specific code example for up-casting


Give a specific code example for down-casting

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String

What is the range of values for byte? Why?

(11:27:37 AM) Decahexahedrpm:
upcasting and downcasting involve extending classes to each other so you can reference classes in each other on multiple levels.
up-casting is getting more general, down-casting is getting more specific
Give a specific code example for up-casting
	int I;
	float F;
	F = 2.43;
	I = F;
    Give a specific code example for down-casting
	Dog d1 = new Dog();		 
	Animal a = d1;	
	Dog d2 = (Dog) a;
    Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
	char e;
	(String) e;
    What is the range of values for byte? Why?
	-128 to 127
bytes only have 8 bits, range of 255
